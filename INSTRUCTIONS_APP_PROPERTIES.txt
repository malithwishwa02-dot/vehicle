MULTILOGIN app.properties DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS
==================================================

AUTHORITY: Dva.12 | STATUS: EXECUTE

OVERVIEW:
This file contains step-by-step instructions for deploying the app.properties 
configuration file to configure Multilogin's Local API port (35000) and custom 
data path.

DEPLOYMENT STEPS:
-----------------

STEP 1: Close Multilogin completely (Task Manager -> End Task)
   - Press Ctrl+Shift+Esc to open Task Manager
   - Find "Multilogin" in the processes list
   - Right-click and select "End Task"
   - Ensure all Multilogin processes are terminated

STEP 2: Press Windows + R, type %appdata%, and press Enter
   - This will open the Windows Roaming AppData folder
   - The full path typically looks like: C:\Users\[YourUsername]\AppData\Roaming

STEP 3: Navigate to the .multiloginapp.com folder (or Multilogin folder depending on version)
   - Look for a folder named ".multiloginapp.com" or "Multilogin"
   - Double-click to open this folder
   - Note: The folder name may vary depending on your Multilogin version

STEP 4: Copy the app.properties file generated above into this folder
   - Locate the app.properties file from your repository root
   - Copy this file into the .multiloginapp.com (or Multilogin) folder
   - If an existing app.properties file exists, you may want to back it up first
   - Replace or overwrite with the new app.properties file

STEP 5: Restart Multilogin
   - Launch Multilogin normally from your Start Menu or Desktop shortcut
   - The application will now use the new configuration settings
   - Local API Port: 35000
   - Custom Data Path: C:/Users/Mahesh-PC/mlx

STEP 6: Verify configuration
   - Open your web browser
   - Navigate to: http://localhost:35000/api/v1/profile/active
   - If configured correctly, you should see a JSON response (even if empty)
   - If you see a connection error, the port configuration may not have applied

TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------
- If verification fails, ensure Multilogin is completely closed before copying the file
- Check that the app.properties file is in the correct folder
- Verify the custom data path (C:/Users/Mahesh-PC/mlx) exists on your system
- Try restarting your computer if the configuration doesn't apply

CONFIGURATION DETAILS:
---------------------
Port: 35000 (Required for Python Bridge integration)
Data Path: C:/Users/Mahesh-PC/mlx (Custom workspace directory)
